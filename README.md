# ReAnimator demo

A demonstration of the patterns and overlays I used in my UFO project.  
I originally wrote the ReAnimator class for My UFO-LEDs-controller project, but that project has a good bit of extra code that doesn't involve showing the animations on an LED strip.  
I took out that extra code and created this demo to make it easier for a user to try out the ReAnimator class.  

[Here's a video of all of the patterns combined with the overlays](https://youtu.be/NvCj_wDtI0o)
